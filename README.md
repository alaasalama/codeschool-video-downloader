Codeschool Video Downloader in Headless mode
============================
This is just a little modification on [this awesome script](https://github.com/wmmc/codeschool-video-downloader), allowing it to work on servers as well (headless mode).

### Additional requirements:
- Install Ruby headless gem:
    ``` gem install headless ```
- Install xvfb
    ``` sudo apt-get install xvfb ```
